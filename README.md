# Time Series Analysis on Arrests in New York City

## Overview

This project analyzes arrest data in New York City using time series analysis techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality in arrest records over time.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Date of arrest
- Type of offense
- Arrest location
- Demographic details (age, gender, etc.)
- Other relevant features

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting raw data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- **Time Series Modeling**: Applying statistical and machine learning models for forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful plots.

## Models Used

- **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: Used for univariate time series forecasting.
- **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL Decomposition)**: Analyzes trends and seasonality.
- **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**: Captures trends and seasonality in the data.
- **Facebook Prophet**: Handles missing data and provides robust trend and seasonality modeling.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**: Deep learning approach for sequential data analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels prophet tensorflow jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Load the `Time Series Analysis on Arrests in New York City.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells to explore and analyze the data.

## Results

- Identified arrest patterns over time.
- Analyzed seasonal trends and periodic fluctuations.
- Built time series models for forecasting arrest rates.
- Compared model performance to determine the most accurate forecasting approach.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Enhance model performance with deep learning techniques.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- Improve hyperparameter tuning for better forecasting accuracy.
